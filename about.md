## Background

The League of Nations is an inter-governmental organisation that strives for world peace. After the World War, many countries were left weakened and found it difficult to transition back to peace time operations. Drafted by President Woodrow Wilson, Lord Robert Cecil, and Jan Smuts, the [Covenant of the League of Nations](/post/1920/02/01/covenant-of-lon.html) would help transpire what would become the League of Nations.
