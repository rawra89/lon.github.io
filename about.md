The League of Nations is an inter-governmental organisation that strives for world peace. After the Great War, the former US president Woodrow Wilson first proposed what would be known as the League of Nations in his famous 14 Points speech. Established in 1920, the League of Nations set out to uphold the values expressed in this speech.
