## What is the League of Nations?

We are an international assembly that strive to prevent future wars, promotes diplomatic cooperation, and ensures collective security among nations. It serves as a congregation for nations to assist in solving disputes, cooperate on international issues, and maintain world peace. The [Covenant of the League of Nations](/post/1920/02/01/covenant-of-lon.html), signed as part of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, would eventually establish the League of Nations.
