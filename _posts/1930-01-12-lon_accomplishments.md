When the League of Nations commemorated Friday its tenth anniversary, worldwide attention was attracted to the achievements of this organization of nations formed for the purpose of promoting world peace, concord among the nations and the welfare of humanity.

The League of Nations can no longer be judged either in the promises or threats uttered in international conference chambers or in the halls of parliament.

The United States has not joined the League of Nations. In joining the world court recently
the United States took occasion to state emphatically that its action was in no way to be interpreted as a step toward entrance into the League of Nations.

Without the entrance of the United States the League of Nations has gone about its business and has done good in the world.

The threat that such an organization as the League of Nations would contribute to bringing about war has been proved to be but fiction. In 1921 one of the first great accomplishments of the League of Nations was when it stopped a conflict between Yugoslavia and Albania which would have produced another
Balkan war and contributed to the unrest of the world.

Later when Turkish troops were over the frontier in Mesopotamia the league council stopped an almost certain war by inducing the Turks to accept a provisional frontier line and an impartial commission of inquiry.

In 1925 the League of Nations prevented a war between Greece and Bulgaria after troops had already advanced on both sides. In a short time after the League of Nations took a hand
the armies retired and the governments accepted an arbitration of a commission from the league. Various other border disputes have been settled by the league.

A most interesting summary of what has been accomplished was given in last Sunday's New York Times magazine, written by Sir Philip Gibbs, who has been present on many of the memorable occasions when achievements toward the perfection of the League were accomplished. A most important chapter in the story of what the League of Nations has done up to date deals with the financial reconstruction of Austria. This was the first experiment in the recovery of Europe by international cooperation.
Austria was saved from the misery and disease which had left a stricken nation after the
war. The league, which had raised a loan of $27,000,000 for Austria, raised another loan of $10,000,000 for Hungary. 

In 1924 the league went to the rescue of Greek refugees. After the victory of Mutapha Kemal Pasha a million Greek refugees had been forced out of their homes. The league, supported by philanthropic societies, made provision so that these people could be saved, housed, clothed and fed.

In the Danzig Free State the league has become the agency for keeping peace between the Germans and the Poles. The league has served as an agency for promoting peace, as an advocate, a protagonist, a propagandist, a press agent, if you please.

Its influence has contributed generally to good feeling among the nations, to the exchange of visits of statesmen representing the various nations which have played no small part in developing the world-wide desire for peace, based on understanding, and for disarmament.

The permanent court of international justice which the United States recently has taken steps to enter was sponsored by the League of Nations.

The health organization of the League of Nations has been a most important factor in preventing the spread of epidemics and in laying down principles for international health control.

Its activities to prevent the traffic in women has caused legislation in various nations and states. It directed the repatriation of 500,000 war prisoners who still had been kept as prisoners of the war four years after the armistice. 

It lent its hand in the rescue of Russian refugees and other victims of the World War and of the revolution. It has undertaken restriction of traffic in opium. It has given consideration to the problems of passports and has taken steps toward suppressing slavery and forced
labor among primitive peoples.

This outline indicates something of what the league has done. It must be judged by what has been accomplished, by facts rather than by fears and in the record thus far there is nothing to sustain any belief that the League of Nations could become an organization which would lead to rivalry, misunderstanding and to war. On the contrary, it has ably done its work in behalf of peace and humanity.
