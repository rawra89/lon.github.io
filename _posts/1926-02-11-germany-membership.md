## LONDON, Feb. 10.
The meeting of the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva on Friday will be brief, its purpose being to fix the date of the special Assembly at which Germany's application for membership will be considered. Sir Austen Chamberlain, M. Briand, Dr. Stresetmann, and Dr. Luther are expected to attend this Assembly, and remain for the session of the Council beginning on March 8. 

In reference to possible difficulties, the correspondent of the "Morning Post" at Geneva says: The most reliable authorities indicate that Spain is certain to be given a permanent seat on the Council simultaneously with Germany, while Poland is pressing her claims, backed up by France and Japan. A semi-official Note issued in Berlin with reference to Germany's application for admission to the League of Nations, deprecates (says Reuter) the cherishing of illusory hopes as to what Germany can attain through membership. The Note declares that Germany can work within the League on international questions, like revision of impracticable treaties, whose maintenance endangers the peace of the world, and can co-operate in universal disarmament. 

Furthermore, adds the Note, the League has taken over a number of special problems which are vitally important to Germany, like the administration of the Saar Valley, the security of Danzig, racial minorities, and colonial mandates, a share in which the German people justifiably claim.

## FRENCH COMMENT

That Germany's admission to the League will be the prelude to a fresh offensive against the Treaty of Versailles is argued by the French newspaper "The Journal" in drawing attention to the forthcoming meeting of M. Briand and the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs (M. Vandevelde). The newspaper declares that. besides Customs tariffs, they will discuss general policy, adding that Belgium is bound to side with France in demanding "essential safeguards." 

The "Gaulois" thinks that the Reich will appear at Geneva as a perpetual plaintii and claimant.
The "Figaro" urges that, since Germany is to have a permanent seat on the Council of the League, Poland should have the same Reuter.

## RUSSIA'S REPLY

A Moscow message says that, in replying to the telegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations announcing that the proposal to adjourn the Disarmament Conference, the Commisar for Foreign Affairs (M. Tchitcherin) agrees to the postponement, but insists, as a condition of the Soviet's participation, that the conference shall not be held in Switzerland. The reply added that the Soviet would prefer as the venue a country which is diplomatically related with the Soviet.- Reuter.
