## GENEVA., Sept. 8 - 
Germany became a member of the League of Nations at noon today.

Twelve years to the day after the tide of the Battle of the Marne turned and the German advance on Paris was halted the last barrier has been removed to bringing into effect the Locarno Treaty, whereby France and Germany promise solemnly never to go to war again.

The vote of the Assembly was unanimous and this afternoon at 5 o'clock the German delegation left Berlin for Geneva. It will take its place in the Assembly Friday morning, and probably Friday afternoon ratifications of the Locarno treaties will be exchanged and they will come into effect.

The United States and Russia are now the only great nations outside the League.

Germany's joining the League brings a basic change in international politics as they have existed since the World War. Since the Peace Conference Germany has been politically a pariah. World affairs and European affairs in particular have been conducted without her cooperation. From noon today that has been changed. Germany is back in good international society and, fortunately, no voice is heard to regret it.

## Spain's Stand Beclouds Triumph.
Today's League triumph was dampened by the possibility of Spain's quitting Geneva because she did not get the permanent Council seat she sought. However, there is hope on all sides that she will accept the semi-permanent seat to be offered her. Brazil, of course stands as retiring from the League because of her disappointment in not getting a big power seat on the Council today when that honor was conferred on Germany immedlately after being voted into the League.

Figuring the profit and loss of today's operation, the general opinion has it that the League has done the best thing in admitting Germany.

After the hectic days of last March, when the Special Assembly was called to admit Germany in accord with the Locarno agreement and falled to do so,
today's events seemed tame. That was because the rough places had been smoothed and the League machinery oiled. There was some slight rebellion by the smaller powers against what they termed the dictation of the great powers, but it petered out quickly and even the rebel leaders voted "Yes" when the roll was called. Mrs. Woodrow Wilson witnessed the admission of Germany. as did Senator Swanson, Representatives Burton and Porter and as many other Americans as could obtain admission to the crowded galleries of the Salle de la RÃ©formation. The historic session of the Assembly opened at 10 o'clock when Giuseppe Motta of Switzerland presented the report calling for the admission of Germany, the election of Germany to a permanent Council seat and an increase of non-permanent members of the Council from six to nine. There was an additional item covering the filling of a few seats which was referred to committee, and the Assembly took up the three main items.

M. Motta explained that membership on the Council being the condition made by Germany on her entrance, Items 1 and 2 were inseparable. and, whereas Item 3 represented a Council compromise on the seats. issue, all three items must go together.

## Advises Reich's Admission.
Then M. Motta advised that nothing be allowed to stand in the way of the immediate admission of Germany. "When Germany is received as a member of the League of Nations the ardent wish of the Swiss nation will be realized," he said. "The necessity of allocating a permanent Council seat to Germany is also imposed by the elementary force of public opinion."

While saying that Switzerland favored placing all Council seats on an elective basis, M. Motta said that so long as a distinction in favor of the great powers existed Germany must be classed as a great power. While there might be a good deal to be said about increasing the number of non- permanent seats, he regarded it as the best policy to agree this time as the best way of settling what had been a costly dispute. He predicted the coming of the day when there would be a general reorganization of the Council, but for today the plan presented was the best. "This is indeed a historical day," he said. "It is a day when through the League of Nations becoming a universal possibility international collaboration will improve, the codification of international law will become a reality and strides will be made toward settling peacefully all conflicts and of realizing disarmament." Jonkheer Louden of Holland opposed the creation of new non-permanent seats, and especially making them semi-permanent, on the ground that this meant an infringement of the rights of the Assembly and an imposition by the larger powers on the smaller nations. However, the desire of his country to see Germany unanimously admitted permitted him, he said, to vote favorably on the measures which had been made by the bloc. Fridtjof Nansen of Norway spoke in similar tone, but said his misgivings were not as strong as his desire to see Germany become a member of the League. Foreign Minister Loefgren of Sweden took a similar stand. And thus
the revolt of the smaller States flickered out.

## Assent Given in Two Tongues.
President Nintchitch of the Assembly then said he would put the first item, namely, the admission of Germany. The roll was then called. Albania answered "Oui," Australia answered "Yes" and down the line through the phlegmatic "Yes" of Sir Austen Chamberlain and the enthusiastic "Oui" of France there was only one answer, although given in two languages. At the end of the roll-call M. Nintchitch announced that forty-eight States had voted and all in favor of the admission of Germany, and one got a thrill to think that the man who announced Germany's admission was a Serb, whose nation was the first to feel the force of the Central Powers in 1914, and winch suffered by fire and sword throughout the war. 

As the announcement was made there was an uproar of applause which died down only to revive again. The applause was unanimous and seemed to mark the passage of the point beyond which there would be no more conquerors and conquered of the World War but only a community of members of the League of Nations. When the second vote was taken and unanimity recorded for giving a permanent Council seat to Germany cheers and applause broke forth again for fully ten minutes. To complete the action, unanimity was given also on the increase of non-permanent seats of the Council.

The session adjourned for a few minutes in the afternoon, and immeditely the Secretary General of the League sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Stresemann informing him that Germany had been admitted, although through broadcasting from the Assembly Hall the news was already known in Berlin. Before the delegates sat. down to lunch word was received from Dr. Stresemann that he was leaving Berlin with his delegation this afternoon.

## Locarno Treaties Now to Be Effective.
Next week the League leaders, with the Germans, will be busy setting up the machinery provided by the five Locarno treaties. It will be recalled that these treaties are:

- First-The Rhineland treaty between France and Belgium on the one hand and Germany on the other hand, guaranteed by England and Italy.

- Second-The arbitration treaty between France and Germany.

- Third-The arbitration treaty between Belgium and Germany.

- Fourth-The arbitration treaty between Germany and Poland.

- Fifth-The arbitration treaty between Germany and Czechoslovakia.

All of them were framed to operate through the League of Nations, which not only is to watch over the observation of Rhineland neutrality but to regulate arbitration measures among the various States involved and remain as judge of the aggressor in the event of violation of the solemn pledge of the signatories not to go to war over their disputes. These treaties have all been ratified and now come into effect on exchange of ratifications. The Germans will bring theirs and the ratification can be exchanged any time after Friday morning.

Dr. Stresemann will make an address the first day he sits in the Assembly. Some fears have been expressed that he will complicate the situation by bringing up some grievance at the beginning of his role as a League delegate war guilt, for example, or Rhineland occupation. 

However, Germans already here say he will not do so and that while he believes in Germany's case on these points, he would regard it as bad grace as a newcomer to throw such controversial subjects into the Assembly arena. Next year Germany will be a regular members of the League when the Assembly meets, and that would be a more propitious time for bringing up the Reich's special
grievances.

Judging by the attitude of the majority of League delegates, this represents a wise choice on the part of the German Foreign Minister. 

## Chamberlain Voices His Delight.
Sir Austen Chamberlain received the journalists this afternoon and expressed gratification at the final success in bringing the Locarno treaties into effect. "Today has justified the optimists in their belief in the power of the League and its usefulness to humanity." he said. "The greatest danger to the League is to regard it as something perfect and less human than it is. Public opinion must realize its defects and human failings, but at the same time the League is capable of still greater services in the future.

"As to Locarno, was there anybody that Saturday morning after the treaties were initialed who was bold enough to believe that they would survive the fortnight we passed through in March? I with all my confidence in Locarno would have hesitated at that time to say that confronted with such a crisis, confronted with the failure to see the entry of Germany, Locarno would have survived.

"The most remarkable thing in March was that the parties interested reasserted their fidelity to the agreement they had signed. I hope this meeting of the Assembly and Council, which sees the entry of Germany into the League and Council, will see deposited by the powers the ratifications of the various treaties."
